# Algorithms-2020
A repo for implementations of algorithms for the class CSCI280 at Oberlin. 


# House Rules
- Have fun with it.
- When you add code please add the folder and not individual files as the files might get messy in the long run.
- Submit a pull request to edit someone else's work.
- Include a small description and a requirements.txt file if there are external libraries used.
